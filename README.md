###### 2011
- Newfound Communications, Inc is acquired by Acme Packet, Inc. for their IP Call Recorder product. The IP Call Recorded become the Net-Net Interactive Session Recorder (ISR). I stay on as Software Engineer with a focus on **GUI development** for ISR.
- I maintain two different dashboards for the ISR. One is J2EE based and the other is Ruby on Rails based. I migrate them both from running on Windows to running on Linux. I become **solely responsible** for the phasing out the J2EE based dashboard and migration all features to the RoR based dashboard.

###### 2010
- I develop a dynamic IVR solution for the State of Utah's Poison Control Center. This includes **full stack** design and implementation. The stack consisted of a **MySQL** database, a J2EE based IVR application running on **Tomcat**, and a GWT based J2EE GUI also running on Tomcat.
- I start to performance test Newfound Communication's home grown products more extensively. I use **JMeter** to automate performance testing and place heavy traffic on the IP Call Recorder's GUI. I also test the performance of the GUI against **large volumes of data (100M+ database records)**.
- This year I start collaborating with the Research and Development group engineers on Performance Testing every aspect of the IP Call Recorder. I generate SIP traffic with **SIPp**, monitor and optimize the impact of large volume of data on the product, etc.
- I learn **Ruby**, **Ruby on Rails** and **JQuery**! I start contributing fixes and new features to the IP Call Recorder's User Dashboard.

- Developed IVR applications that integrate to the Newfound Communications IP Call Recorder, an enterprise grade **VoIP call recorder**.
- I start to help provide **customer support** during the off hours for the hosted business of Newfound Communications, Inc.

###### 2008
- This year I start using **Java** at a professional level. I develop **J2EE** applications to serve dynamic content for voice apps. I use **Hibernate** and **Spring** on the backend to speed up development and focus on the business requirements.
- This year I learn **VXML** and about **Interactive Voice Response (IVR)** application design. Designing IVR applications, through flow of dialog, teaches me the importance and value of **user experience**. I also integrate the voice apps to the two leading platforms for IVR: Nuance's Platform and Voxeo's Prophecy.
- June - Accepted and started a full time employment as a **Software Engineer** at Newfound Communications, Inc. for the Professional Services group.
