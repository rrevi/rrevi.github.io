title: The 2021 Apple MacBook Pro are fast üèéüí®
intro: A major leap in performance for personal computers is upon us 
---

With the introduction of the [5th generation 2021 Apple MacBook Pro][0] laptops with their [M1 Pro and M1 Max][1] chipsets on October of this year, Apple leaped personal computing performance forward many times over. Don't believe me? I am about to show you.

Here's is the hardware we are about to compare:

Spec               | 13" MacBook Pro       | 14" MacBook Pro
------------------ | --------------------- | ---------------------
Model Year         | 2018                  | 2021
CPU                | Intel Core i5 4-core  | M1 Pro 8-core
Graphics           | Intel Iris Plus 655   | M1 Pro 14-core
RAM                | 8GB                   | 16GB
Storage (SSD)      | 512GB                 | 512GB
Wi-Fi              | 802.11ac              | 802.11ax Wi-Fi 6


As for what software I will be running to compare the performance of these two generations of MacBook Pros, it will be developer focused. Meaning, I will running a number of software development commands, to mimic activities a software developer would do, and show the difference in real time that it took to execute said commands. Here we go...

Command               | 13" MacBook Pro       | 14" MacBook Pro
--------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------
Install Ruby 3.0.2    | 346s                  | 144s
Install Python 3.9.9  | 127s                  | 54s
Build a Docker project| 28s                   | 12s

On average, the 2021 14" MacBook Pro was **2.3x** faster! If that doesn't catch your attention, or get you excited, not sure what will.

Think about it this way, in 2021, the Tesla Model 3 Long Range is rated at 0-60 mph in 4.2 seconds. The level of performance upgrade that the 2021 14" MacBook Pro brings is like if the 2022 Tesla Model 3 Long Range all of a sudden had a rating of 0-60 mph in 1.8 seconds!

Don't believe me still? Well, read more about it [here][2] and [here][3]. Or, watch more about it [here][4] and [here][5].
