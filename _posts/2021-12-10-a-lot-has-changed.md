intro: Jquery is out, in with Jekyll's minima theme
---

It's a been quite a while since I written something up, but before I do let's remove JQuery and JQuery Mobile, and upgrade to the latest [Jekyll minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima).

Why remove JQuery you may ask? Well, because the Javascript language has come a long way since the early 2010s when the abstraction and utilities of JQuery made sense. Don't believe me? [read through this](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/25208). I'm also not interested in supporting legacy Web browsers.

Why remove the mobile-first JQuery Mobile theme you may ask? Well, because mobile friendly themes are now the norm (and also because you need JQuery which I removed, remember?).
