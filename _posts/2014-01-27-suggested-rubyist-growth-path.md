title: The growing Rubyist
intro: My short take on a good path to become a Rubyist
---

1. The new born Rubyist

- Learn Ruby in college, if possible

2. Mid-life crisis

- Metaprogramming Ruby: read this book immediately after college or about 1 year of professional Ruby experience

3. Retirement

- Ruby Under a Microscope: keep in mind that @nusco talks quite a bit of time reinforcing the importance of understanding the context of what you are working on; this book is a great segue to understanding what is going on in the Ruby interpreter with respect to the current context of your Ruby program. Also, this book is a great example on advanced Computer Science topics (I'd say Master's level).
